# Scavenger
A game about scavenging parts, and creating turrets to fend off enemies.

Note: this project is archived, and won't be continued, due to lack of general cohesiveness, usage of the JVM, and bad code.
Any further attempts at game development will be done in a better language, and prototyped to avoid a game that simply isn't fun.
